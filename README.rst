``jaraco.util`` contains a number of nominally useful, reusable classes
and functions. Each is designed to be intuitively named and
self-documenting (many with extensive doctests), though
the project is also documented with runnable tests.

Deprecation
-----------

In general, this grab-bag of routines is deprecated, with much of the
functionality moved or pending move to another, more appropriate home.
